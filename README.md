<!-- Modifications to the GFDL dry core Fortran source for a series of experiments with the thermal damping timescale. For more info, see recent publication. -->
# Summary
All sorts of useful tools for running and processing parameter sweep experiments with the dry core model in [this repository](https://github.com/lukelbd/gfdl-drycore.git).

# Benchmarks
Some benchmarks for running the dry core model on various machines are provided below.

## Cheyenne
| Model time(s) | Process time(s) | Days | Nodes | Cores | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 29s, 26s | 294s, 184s | 5 | 1 | 8 | No background processing |
