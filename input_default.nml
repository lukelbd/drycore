! Primary namelist for running GFDL spectral core
! * Most names are self-explanatory; alpha has to do with finite differencing scheme,
!   and damping coefficient is for hyperdiffusion on small scales.
! * Not sure why num_fourier means truncation number and num_spherical has to be
!   one more than that, or what happens if this isn't satisfied.
